# Problem Set 4

## Overview

This was an assignment for SIS 750 - Data Analysis for Dr Austin Hart in Spring 2024 at American University in Washington DC.

For this problem set, the class was tasked with recreating detailed visual graphs from published websites and studies. After learning about the detail orientation that was required for data visualisation, this was put to work in the two questions we were asked to complete. 

- Question 1
  - Replicate the senate seat plot from FiveThirtyEight.com using their data set from their simulations predicting party distribution in the 2022 midterms. 
    - Everything except the arrow and the small text blob directly on the graph was to be replicated to the best of our capabilities. 

- Question 2
  - Replicate a scatter plot using data collected on blue jays with the corresponing caption to the figure.
    - All elements of the parent plot was to be replicated in full.
